Problem Statement

Let's dive into the interesting topic of regular expressions! You are given some inputs and you are required to check whether they are valid mobile numbers.

A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with 7, 8 or 9.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N followed by N lines, each containing some string.

Output Format

For every string listed, print YES if it is a valid mobile number and NO if it isnâ€™t.

Constraints 
1 <= N <= 10 
Mobile Number contains valid alpha-numeric characters 
2 <= len(Number) <= 15
